This is my first time to attempt to use blogdown building our(my wife and me) website. I want to summarise some problems i meet as a novice.

- first, as a novice, although i know nothing about website building, i can post my blog in my own website follow the steps, so please read it carefully.

- second, we should have our own domain name before you want to build a website

- third, you new domain if is in domestic, it have to be filed about a period, so don’t hurry.

Hope these suggestions can help you, if they’re something wrong, please free free to let me know.
